    <div class="tips_Title"> #1 Don’t start Without an End in Mind</div>
    <div class="tips_Text">
        <p>Starting a new task or project can be a daunting thing. Oftentimes we
            don’t know where it’s heading, or if it will turn out to be our best
            work yet or something to throw in the trash can. This is when it’s
            important to understand that in order to create good work
            consistently, you need to start with an end in mind, or, at the very
            least, a strong direction to follow.
            
            Many creators start aimlessly and end up worn out, uninspired, and
            unhappy. What they end up creating isn’t meeting their expectations
            or standards, and it doesn’t go the way they want it to go. This is
            because they don’t set proper, achievable goals for the project.
            
            Start your project by having an end in mind. Have an idea of the
            painting you want to create and the direction you want to take it. If
            you’re writing a book, know where your story should lead. The great
            thing about this is that we are not bound to this end. Happy
            accidents happen, and we might find that we want to follow an even
            better path. Having this kind of goal is simply an anchor; the “true
            north” for our creative compass that will guide us through the
            unknown and uncertain in our creation process.

    <div class="tips_Title"> #2 Fear Of Messing Up</div>
    <div class="tips_Text">
        <p>In all things, I believe that being bold and pushing the boundaries of
            what you have tried before is what will really allow you to shine. In
            visual art, creating bold strokes, designs, and shapes can make your
            artworks truly stand out and come alive. In business, sometimes the
            most outrageous ideas can gain traction and become the norm. You
            just have to let go of the fear of failure.
            
            Dare to mess up your work! Perhaps that will be what allows you to
            realize how to continue to make it even better than before. Just like
            in evolution in nature itself, where mutations, being random errors,
            can sometimes prove to be highly beneficial to the survival and
            success of a species, so can random errors benefit your creative
            project.
            
            Experimentation and exploration are key in unlocking the creative
            potential you have within yourself. Dare to mine the fertile veins of
            creativity that reside deep within you.

    <div class="tips_Title"> #4 Not Using References</div>
    <div class="tips_Text">
        <p>This bottleneck is one of the most common of all. People look at
            using references and guides as some form of cheating, stealing or
            plagiarism. This couldn’t be further from the truth. You need
            references to create work quickly, and with good results.
            
            It is surprisingly hard to mimic entirely what another has created.
            This is especially true with the arts, but it also applies to almost all
            other fields. What you create will always have your personal and
            unique signature on it.
            
            As you are producing your work, use references to solidify your
            understanding of the fundamentals of the subject. Find masterpieces
            of art and reference them in your own work. Look at how Apple
            makes new products and use their strategies for your own business.
            Listen to Howard Shore’s music and how his cadences cater to the
            emotions of the audience. Don’t try to reinvent the wheel, but rather
            improve upon it.

    <div class="tips_Title"> #5 Practice Makes Progress, Not Perfects</div>
    <div class="tips_Text">
        <p>The perfectionist mindset is a hard one to get out of. It presents a
            dilemma of whether you should strive to improve your creation until
            it reaches its apex, or call it finished and move on because you’ll get
            more done and improve even more quickly.
            
            My advice is to never lose that thirst for excellence. Stay on the
            course of always seeking improvement. But learn when to call it
            finished. It is entirely up to you. You could spend an extra three days
            on this task, or identify the 20% of the aspects that make up 80% of
            the quality of your work and double down on those to finish earlier.
            
            Very often we hear “practice makes perfect”. This presupposes that
            perfection exists as a tangible thing. It doesn’t. It is up to us to
            subjectively decide what is perfect. A much better sentiment is that
            practice makes progress. You will always progress, learn new things
            and improve yourself and your craft. Keep striving for excellence, but
            know when to say “this is done”.
